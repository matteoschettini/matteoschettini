# 🌌 Hi, I'm Matteo

Hi, I'm **Matteo**, a Computer Science graduate from the **University of Turin** (*BSc in Computer Science*), now fully focused on exploring and mastering the **Cloud world** and the rapidly evolving field of **Artificial Intelligence**.

I love building **clean, scalable solutions** and learning technologies that push the boundaries of what’s possible — from backend engineering to cloud architectures, automation, and intelligent systems.

## 🧭 What I'm focusing on

- ☁️ **Cloud Computing** – distributed systems, scalability, reliability  
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence** – applied ML, intelligent services, automation  
- 🛠️ **Backend Engineering** – APIs, services, clean architectures  
- 🗄️ **Data & Databases** – relational data, modeling, performance  
- 🔐 **Security & Best Practices** – secure coding, safe architectures  

---

## 🧩 How I like to work

- I care about **clarity**: readable code, explicit logic, clear naming.  
- I prefer **scalable designs** over quick hacks.  
- I enjoy **understanding how things work under the hood**, not just using tools.  
- I see every project as a way to **learn a new concept deeply** (cloud, AI, or architecture).

---

## 🚀 Projects & ideas I enjoy

- 🧠 Apps that use **AI** to make everyday workflows smarter  
- ☁️ **Cloud-backed platforms** that can actually scale
